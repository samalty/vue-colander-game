# Colander Game

![](static/img/colander3.PNG)

The 'colander game' is a dinner party game which essentially combines articulate with charades, with a couple of other twists thrown in for good measure. The game typically involves drawing pieces of paper from a colander or another bowl-shaped utensil. This simple application enables users to play the colander game on a mobile phone while out and about, eliminating the need for a pad of paper and a colander.

## How it works

Provided with a form, players are invited to submit various items - the equivalent of scribbling on a piece of paper and adding it to the colander. Players can submit whatever they want (the name of a celebrity, song, adjective, etc.). There is also a settings form whereby players can decide upon time limits and the number of rounds to be played. Once the colander is sufficiently full and the settings form submitted, the game will begin.

Having been split into two teams, players take turns describing items that are drawn at random from the colander to their team mates via various means (these are explained in the 'how to play' section on the app's home page). Each turn is against the clock, as displayed on screen. When time runs out, the phone is to be passed over to the other team for the next player's turn.

When a team guesses an item correctly, its score increments by one. Each player is allowed to pass on one item per turn. However, the item may reappear during that turn if the colander is otherwise empty. In which case, the player will have no choice but to attempt that item again. Otherwise, passed items are returned to the colander at the beginning of each turn.

The emptying of the colander instigates the beginning of the next round, at which point all items will be passed back into the colander. The current round is displayed on screen. Where the colander becomes empty midway through a player's turn, the timer will pause, enabling the player to complete their remaining time according to the rules of the new round.
